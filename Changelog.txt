1.03.342.0
API Change (#81): Create ByteString class, mapping UA ByteString to ByteString instead of byte[], affects API, request/responses and e.g. NodeId opaque value type. 

Fixed (#8): SampleClient uses the #22 cert store and validation
Fixed (#9): StringUtils.addLineBreaks is now used when storing Cert and PrivKey in pem mode
Fixed (#13): Fixed a problem where server socket goes to unrecoverable CLOSE_WAIT state

Fixed (#44): Sun JCE Crypto/Certificate fallback is now by default disabled 
Fixed (#77): EncoderUtils: Array of Structures is serialized correctly
Fixed (#82): Variant accepts any dimension (+scalar) Enumeration arrays and converts it to equivalent integer array. For Variants containing Integer arrays (or scalar), can be converted to Enumerations via asEnum method
Fixed (#87): SunJCECryptoProvider.base64Decode handles line breaks (Fixed as part of #9)
Fixed (#97): Fixed BinaryDecoder.getVariant ArrayDimensions handling (via pull request #101)

New (#80): Client new method discoverServersOnNetwork

1.03.341.0
API Change (Github #49): NodeClass.Unspecified is removed

Build Change (Github #43, #46, #48): The 'jdk6' profile is no longer active by default. NOTE! in order to be sure that the built jar works on java 6, please build using the 'jdk6' profile, this does require the use of maven toolchains and jdk6 installation.

New (Github #50): Added StandardEngineeringUnits class that contains a set of standard units
New/Changed (Github #52): Added StatusWrite and TimestampWrite enum constants to AccessLevel

Note (Github #27 and #26): No changes needed for Union and Optional Structure Fields, because it is purely serializer implementation and out of scope for the stack, because the standard model does not define such types.

New: IEncoder.put(), IDecoder.get, EncoderUtils 
Fixed (Mantis 1810, which was supposed to be fixed already...): Do not check the securityMode when opening the channel - to enable only secure endpoints used for actual connections (since GetEndpoints must be performed over an insecure channel, anyway) 
Fixed: Do not use namespace to calculate ExpandedNodeId.hashCode() - since the same namespace will give different hashCodes depending on which is used 
Changed (Mantis 1534): NumericRange supports several dimensions 
Changed: ExpandedNodeId used in places where NodeId was previously used (especially in Structure types). In addition, EncoderContext is required in some methods. The EncoderContext object is available from Server and Client objects. 
Changed: XmlDecoder.setNamespaceTable() to enable mapping of namespace indexes between XmlElements and the target system 
Changed: Refactored HttpsServerSecureChannel to inherit from AbstractServerSecureChannel
